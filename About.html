                       It has been my dream to become a programmer and a designer since my kinder garden. I have the passion and feeling that i can do it, since many people in my country  aren't going for it because they think its a waste of time. That's one of the reasons that motivated me to go and study about it and become one in the future. What also motivated me the most is that, tecnology is moving at a very fast rate and we africians are lacking far behind when it comes to tecnology. I can say tecnology is now one of the main factors that is making the world a better place. People are inventing new things, unimmaginable things and making a huge amout of money from it.This is why i want to study and become a designer and a programmer.

                        My name is Momodou Jah. I was born  and raised in essau. I started and completed my schooling in essau. During my school days i always have this  dream of becoming a programmer. It first came to me when i was waching a youtube video about how programmers and designers used to designer beautiful and unimmaginable things i was so amazed and at that moment i really wanted to become one in the future.
                        After i finished school my dream was to go to the university and study computer science, but my grades waren't enough for me to be enrolled as a university student. I later heard on th radio that the Management Deverlopment Institude (MDI) are offering a computer science course. I when online ad checked about the status of MDI. I later called them and went for an interviewed, i was taken and thank god am now pursueing my drams of becoming a programmer and a designer.
